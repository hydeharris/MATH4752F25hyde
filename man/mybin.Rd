\title{Simulate a binomial distribution and plot outcomes}
\usage{
mybin(iter = 100, n = 10, p = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{iter}{Number of simulation iterations (default = 100).}

\item{n}{Number of Bernoulli trials in each iteration (sample size).}

\item{p}{Probability of success on each Bernoulli trial (default = 0.5).}
}
\value{
A barplot of the simulated distribution is displayed.
        Invisibly returns nothing.
}
\description{
Runs a Monte Carlo simulation of a binomial distribution by generating
repeated Bernoulli samples, then plots the empirical distribution of
the number of successes.
}
\examples{
# Run a simulation with default settings
mybin()

# Run with 200 iterations, 20 trials per iteration, success probability 0.3
mybin(iter = 200, n = 20, p = 0.3)
}
